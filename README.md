# topview_codetest

Specification:
We’d like you to develop a simple product reservation page for bike rentals. Please use the attached JSON data, and provide the user with the option to rent bikes. The test should not take more than 2 hours to complete. Requirements:

You have the option to use any technologies available to you, or simple HTML, CSS, and JS.

The test should include a complete checkout process, which means users should be able to select the type of product, select the number of product, view a summary before checkout, and in the end, check out. Please think about how a checkout process usually is and make the checkout experience as smooth as possible.

Users cannot check out with accessories or add-ons only - they must come with a bike selection.

The content displayed should be responsive for mobile and desktop. Be mindful of element sizes and alignment.

You can use a UI design you are comfortable with. The design doesn’t have to be fancy but the page should be organized and easy to navigate.

Provide access to the see the code and a live demo link to see the page working.

Comments:
Built the most basic product page with functionality to add products to cart and check to make sure a bike was on the order, used pure functional components to count up the quantity total.
No styling adding, used basic semantic UI for buttons and grid layout.
Works on mobile and desktop.
If I was spending more time on it I would build out the cart as a seperate page in the SPA and add more styling.
